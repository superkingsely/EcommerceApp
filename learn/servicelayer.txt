Here’s the same content explained **clearly in a well-written format**, showing how the business logic fits into each service of your e-commerce project:

---

### 🛍 **Product Service**

This service will handle everything related to **products** in your store.
Typical business logic here includes:

* **Adding, updating, or deleting products** from the system.
* **Managing product stock levels**, so that customers can only buy available products.
* **Validating categories** before saving a product to ensure that every product belongs to a valid category.

👉 Service Name: `ProductService`

---

### 🧭 **Category Service**

This service focuses on **product categories**, which help in organizing products.
Its business logic includes:

* Adding, updating, or deleting categories.
* Making sure there are **no duplicate categories** (e.g., two “Electronics” categories).
* **Checking if a category still has products** before deleting it, to avoid breaking references.

👉 Service Name: `CategoryService`

---

### 👤 **User Service**

This service manages **user accounts and profiles**.
Its business logic includes:

* Registering new users while **hashing passwords securely** before saving them.
* Allowing users to update their profile details.
* Ensuring **unique emails** so that no two users can register with the same email address.

👉 Service Name: `UserService`

---

### 🧾 **Order Service**

This service controls how **orders** are created and managed.
The business logic includes:

* Creating new orders with all the items a user wants to buy.
* **Calculating the total price** of the order, including quantities and any applicable discounts or shipping.
* Checking if products in the order have enough **stock** before confirming the order.
* Updating the **order status** (e.g., Pending, Paid, Shipped, Delivered).

👉 Service Name: `OrderService`

---

### 🛒 **Cart Service** *(optional / later stage)*

This service manages the **shopping cart**, where users select products before checkout.
Its business logic includes:

* Adding and removing items from the cart.
* Making sure the **cart stays in sync with product stock**, so users can’t add more than what’s available.
* Calculating the **subtotal** (price before tax or shipping).

👉 Service Name: `CartService`

---

### 💳 **Payment Service** *(optional / later stage)*

This service handles **payment processing** for orders.
Business logic includes:

* Processing actual payments through a payment gateway.
* Updating the order status to “Paid” or “Failed” based on the payment result.
* Recording payment transaction details for reference.

👉 Service Name: `PaymentService`

---

✅ **Summary:**

* Product Service → handles products and stock
* Category Service → organizes products into categories
* User Service → manages user accounts and authentication
* Order Service → manages orders and pricing
* Cart Service → handles shopping cart operations
* Payment Service → manages payments and order updates

Would you like me to now write the **actual interface structure (IService)** for each of these services (like the one you did for `IProductService`)?
