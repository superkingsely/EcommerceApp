You can GET, POST, PUT, DELETE your data right from Swagger UI.
Once these are working, we can move to:

✅ Authentication (JWT / Identity)

🛒 Cart & Checkout logic

🧠 Refactoring to Services & DTOs.

🧭 2. Where Companies Usually Go

Most professional projects use Repository Pattern (and often Service Layer) to separate responsibilities.

Typical architecture:

Controller ➝ Service (Business Logic) ➝ Repository (Data Access) ➝ DbContext ➝ Database

🧰 3. Why Repository Pattern Is Used

✅ Keeps controllers clean and focused on HTTP handling.

🧠 Centralizes all database access logic.

🧪 Makes unit testing much easier (you can mock repositories).

🔁 Reusable methods — don’t repeat logic in multiple controllers.

🧱 4. When to Implement It

There are two good times to do it:

Option A (Recommended): After confirming your DbContext + CRUD endpoints work (exactly where you are now).

Option B: At the start of the project — if you’re already sure of your domain.

So yes, this is the perfect time to start implementing repositories in your e-commerce app.

🧭 5. How It Fits in Your Solution

📂 ECommerce.Domain

Entities

Interfaces (e.g. IUserRepository, IProductRepository)

📂 ECommerce.Infrastructure

Implement repositories (e.g. UserRepository : IUserRepository)

Use AppDbContext inside them

📂 ECommerce.Application (Optional but recommended)

Business logic / services

📂 ECommerce.API

Controllers call the services or repositories.
